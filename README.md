# NLS_soliton_condensates_minimal_intensity
Computation of poly-continua of minimal Dirichlet energies with preassigned anchor set. Accompanies ArXiv paper:  
"Dirichlet energy  and focusing NLS condensates  of minimal intensity", M. Bertola, A. Tovbis.
It contains the key code to generate the figures in the paper. 
Just run the front-end NLS_Condensates_Exploration_interactive.m, which is an interactive front-end to explore the poly continua of minimal intensity (Dirichlet energy) explained in the paper. You can move add, remove the anchor points and decide how many stagnation points. If you edit the file you can change the external field from the default (Im (z)) to any Im(phi) with phi a real polynomial without constant coefficient.
